        <p>Capitalised words are usually keywords for a specific effect.</p>
        <div>
            <h1>Major mechanics:</h1>
            <p><span class="keyword">Marks</span> are debuffs Applied to enemies, when that enemy takes attack damage, a Mark is Expended for 'X = half that damage' for one of the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Damage Mark  - Deal X Damage</li>
                <li>Block Mark - Gain X Block</li>
                <li>Vamp Mark - Heal X HP</li>
                <li>Stun Mark - Stun enemy for 1 turn (stun effect does not stack)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Marks are expended in a set order (the order they are stated above), so if an enemy has 1 Damage, 3 Block, 2 Vamp and 1 Stun Mark, successive instances of damage will Expend Marks in this order: D B B B V V S (there are in-game ways to change this order)</p>

            <p><span class="keyword">Essence</span> is considered a player buff, for each Essence type, when you have 10 or more stacks of it, Consume 10 of that Essence until you have less than 10 (e.g. If you have 0 and Gain 27 Blue Essence, 27->17->7, result is 2 Blue Essence procs with 7 stacks remaining) for one of the following:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Red Essence - Deal 10 Damage to all enemies</li>  
                <li>Blue Essence - Gain 10 Block</li>
                <li>Purple Essence - Apply 1 Weak and 1 Vulnerable to all enemies</li>
                <li>Yellow Essence - Gain 1 Energy, Draw 1 Card</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>Essence is not removed at the end of turn and does not last between fights.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    The main theme for the class is Vampirism - not a million miles away from Ironclad, but encourages strategic HP management.
                    <br>
                    The class was designed to be easy to engage with, but also provide depth in maximising the use of the plentiful resources available and strong synergies.

                            Parallel Essence was the main pillar for the two sets of mechanics: each essence type maps onto a mark type (Red-Damage, Blue-Block, Purple-Vamp, Yellow-Stun).
                            <br> 
                            Easier to learn each system since they mirror each other so closely: 1 Damage effect, 1 Block effect and 2 uniques.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Cards</strong> are grouped by type: Attacks, Powers, Skills. 
                            Within each they are ordered by rarity: Common (Grey), Uncommon (Blue), Rare (Gold). 
                            <br>
                            () brackets denote the effect of upgrading a card. 
                            [] brackets contain a calculated value. Energy cost is in the top left. 
                            <br>
                            Card names were designed to be as thematic as possible. 
                            The distribution of types, costs, rarities across the card pool, as with potions and relics, is designed to be in line with the other classes in the game.

                        <p>
                            A few interesting comments about how this class interacts with base game mechanics. 
                            Since almost all block is gained indirectly, the player is effectively immune to Frail (decreases block gain). 
                            <br>
                            Meanwhile being weakened (decreases attack) severely hampers the effectiveness of marks but not essence. 
                            Dexterity gains or losses (add/sub to block gained) have almost no effect on the player as well. 
                            Low max HP makes being vulnerable (take more damage) a lot more risky. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With proper balance of the class, these aren't major issues, however there are a few relics in the base game which e.g. give +1 dexterity, which would likely be better off being removed/replaced for this class. 
                            Marks might also be too inconsistent - very lacklustre if damage output is low (e.g. while weakened) and overpowered when it's high (+strength and enemy vulnerable). 
                            So long as this feels like it's in the player's hands as opposed to RNG, this should be ok.
